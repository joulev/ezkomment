## Metadata

**URL:** https://demo.ezkomment.joulev.dev

**License:** [MIT](https://github.com/joulev/ezkomment/blob/main/LICENSE)

## Written in other frameworks

All demos here are written in React.

### How about plain HTML?

Writing it in plain HTML is possible [[1]](https://ezkomment.joulev.dev/docs/comments/embed) [[2]](https://ezkomment.joulev.dev/docs/customisation/introduction) [[3]](https://ezkomment.joulev.dev/docs/rest-api/introduction) but I'd rather not do it if a framework with better developer experience is available.

### How about Vue, Svelte, Angular, etc.?

I don't know them yet (at the time of writing). If I learn them in the future and feel like doing so, I will update this repository with more examples. In the meantime pull requests and discussions are always welcome!
