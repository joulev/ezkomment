# `@ezkomment/client`

The client of the app hosted at https://ezkomment.vercel.app. Written in Next.js and styled by
Tailwind CSS.

## Set up a development server

```sh
# start from repository root
$ lerna bootstrap
$ cd packages/client
$ npm run dev
```

Now a development server is deployed to http://localhost:3000.

## Deploy your own instance

Currently we don't have any environment variables or special configuration to take note of.
Therefore you can simply deploy with all default settings on platforms such as Vercel or Netlify
and the app will be up and running.
