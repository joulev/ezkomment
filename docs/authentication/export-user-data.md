# Export user data

You can request all data associated to you, including your information, your sites and all pages under each of those sites, to be exported as JSON. This data can then be parsed, processed and used to import to other tools of your choice.

To do so, follow these steps:

- Sign in to ezkomment if you have not already done so.

- Navigate to **Account settings** on the navigation bar. Alternatively, on desktops you can click on your profile picture on the top right.

- Under **Export all data**, click on **Request data**.

- A JSON file is then downloaded. Note that many browsers may prompt you for downloading approval first for security reasons (e.g. "Do you want to accept downloads from ezkomment.joulev.dev?"). In those cases, grant your approval to continue downloading.
