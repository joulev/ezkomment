# Delete account

## This is dangerous!

Since we do not store any permanent information in our database, all deletion actions are **irreversible**. If you delete your account, all data associated to that account in the database will be lost forever, and there is no way to recover it. All of your sites, pages and comments on ezkomment will be gone. Therefore, please think twice and consider exporting all data before deleting your account.

## Unhappy or frustrated?

If you feel that the service can be improved, you are more than welcome to contact us publicly [on GitHub](https://github.com/joulev/ezkomment/discussions) or privately via [email](mailto:me@joulev.dev) or [Telegram](https://t.me/joulev3). We take all user feedbacks seriously and we will always try to make improvements to the product if it is possible and reasonable.

## Steps to delete account

- Sign in to ezkomment if you have not already done so.

- Navigate to **Account settings** on the navigation bar. Alternatively, on desktops you can click on your profile picture on the top right.

- Under **Delete account**, click on **Continue**.

- Since account deletion is a dangerous action, you will be prompted to reauthenticate with either GitHub or Google, depending on how you sign in. A popup window will appear to handle this. If your browser blocks it, disable blocking popups and try again.

- Click **Delete** in the modal.
