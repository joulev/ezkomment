# Update information

You can update your account information at any time.

## Update display name

The display name is how ezkomment identifies you outside the code context (e.g. in supporting tickets). Therefore, we recommend using your real name (or a name you are comfortable with) as your ezkomment display name, although this is not required.

To update your display name, follow these steps:

- Sign in to ezkomment if you have not already done so.

- Navigate to **Account settings** on the navigation bar. Alternatively, on desktops you can click on your profile picture on the top right.

- Input your new display name under **Profile** > **Display name**.

- Click **Save**. Note that this button is disabled if the new name is the same as the current display name.

## Update profile picture

Similar to the display name, it is not required that the profile picture is an actual photo of you.

To update your profile picture, follow these steps:

- Sign in to ezkomment if you have not already done so.

- Navigate to **Account settings** on the navigation bar. Alternatively, on desktops you can click on your profile picture on the top right.

- Under **Profile** > **Profile photo**, click on the circle on the right and upload the profile picture you want. Supported file formats are PNG (`.png` file extension) and JPEG (either `.jpg` or `.jpeg` file extension) &ndash; if your photo is in a different format, please convert it first.

  It is recommended to use an image with 1&#8239;:&#8239;1 aspect ratio (a square) to avoid distortion when the image is displayed.

- In the circle on the right, a (large) preview of your picture is shown. If you are not satisfied with it, repeat the previous step with a different image.

- Click **Save**. Your profile picture will be automatically updated, and the previous profile picture is permanently deleted.
