# Create a new page

- Visit the site dashboard of the site under which you want to create a new page.

- Click on **Add a new page**.

- You will be asked for _page title_ and _page URL_. Enter them.

  They are purely for identification purposes only &ndash; they will help you identify pages in the site dashboard, but do no more than that. We do not use this information internally.

  We recommend the page title to be the title of your webpage, and the page URL to be the URL of your webpage (of course). However you are free to name it however you want.

  To promote good practice, the page URL must be under the site domain. If you want to bypass this restriction, change the site domain to [`*`](/docs/sites-and-pages/create-new-site#site-domain).

- Click on **Create**.

- You will be redirected to the page domain. Congratulations, the ezkomment page has been created!
