# Export site data

You can request all data associated to your ezkomment site and all pages under it to be exported as JSON. This data can then be parsed, processed and used to import to other tools of your choice.

To do so, follow these steps:

- Visit the site dashboard, either from the [overall dashboard](/app/dashboard) or from the URL in this syntax

  ```
  https://ezkomment.joulev.dev/app/site/⟨siteName⟩
  ```

- On the navigation bar, click on **Settings**.

- Under **Export all data**, click on **Request data**.

- A JSON file is then downloaded. Note that many browsers may prompt you for downloading approval first for security reasons (e.g. "Do you want to accept downloads from ezkomment.joulev.dev?"). In those cases, grant your approval to continue downloading.
