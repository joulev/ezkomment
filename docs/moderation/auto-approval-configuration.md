# Auto-approval configuration

This configuration dictates whether a new comment would be automatically approved and visible to the public immediately, or it requires manual approval from you as the page administrator ([see more](/docs/moderation/introduction)).

You can update the auto-approval configuration at any time for any ezkomment pages you have. To do so, follow these steps:

- Visit the page dashboard of the page whose configuration you want to update.

- On the navigation bar, click on **Settings** to go to the page settings.

- Under **Automatic approval**, use the switch on the right to set the configuration.

Note that, with auto-approval disabled, when a user inputs a new comment, it will _not_ be shown automatically. This may cause confusion, therefore we recommend updating the help text in the comment section (see [Customisation](https://google.com)) to clarify this.
