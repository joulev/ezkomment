# Customise site template

To customise an ezkomment site's template, or to simply play with a template, follow these steps:

- Use a laptop, or at least a reasonably wide tablet in landscape orientation. Coding is involved here, and trust me, you would not want to code with your smartphone.

- Visit your site dashboard

- On the navigation bar, click on **Customise display**

- In the editor, you can now either use your own code or tweak existing code in the provided editor, and see how it looks in the preview on the right.

- Click on **Comments** at the top to switch to the comments view, where you can add and remove sample comments in the preview.

- You can also click on **Dark** to see how your template would look in [dark mode](/docs/comments/embed#dark-mode).

- If your website uses a background colour different from white and black, you can also tweak the preview background colour by clicking on **Preview Bg**.

- When you feel that you are happy with your template, click on **Deploy** to deploy it to all comment sections under that site.

Note that the editor does not have auto-save &ndash; it does not save your work. When you deploy a new template, the old template is also forever deleted. Therefore, we recommend you keep track of your templates locally with version control (e.g. using `git`). If you feel like we should maintain all versions of your work instead for ease in revision management, convince my backend mate [here](https://github.com/joulev/ezkomment/discussions/196).
