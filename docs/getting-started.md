# Getting started

## Introduction

Welcome to ezkomment!

ezkomment is a product-as-a-service intended to provide an easy interface for you to embed a comment section to any websites.

This guide will help you set up your account, create your first site and finally get your comment section up, running and accessible by anyone from anywhere in the world.

## Create a new account

You can sign up for an ezkomment account if you already have [a GitHub account](https://github.com) or [a Google account](https://google.com). The whole process will be passwordless, as you will be directed to sign in with these third-party provider instead. If you do not yet have an account with any of these providers, please create an account there first. We [do not intend to support email-based authentication](https://github.com/joulev/ezkomment/discussions/59) in the future, and if you would like to log in by a different provider instead, [please open an issue](https://github.com/joulev/ezkomment/issues/new).

If you already have either a GitHub account or a Google account, you can continue in respective sections.

### Sign up with GitHub

- Navigate to [the authentication page](https://ezkomment.joulev.dev/auth).

- Click on "Continue with GitHub".

- There will be a pop-up for the auth provider to continue. If your browser blocks that pop-up, please allow it and try again, otherwise go to next step.

- In the pop-up, if GitHub prompts you for sign in credentials, that means you are not yet authenticated with GitHub, so please sign in first. Otherwise go to next step.

- Click "Authorize".

- The pop-up should close automatically and you will be redirected to the ezkomment dashboard. You have successfully created your ezkomment account.

### Sign up with Google

- Navigate to [the authentication page](https://ezkomment.joulev.dev/auth).

- Click on "Continue with Google".

- There will be a pop-up for the auth provider to continue. If your browser blocks that pop-up, please allow it and try again, otherwise go to next step.

- In the pop-up, if Google prompts you for sign in credentials, that means you are not yet authenticated with Google, so please sign in first. Otherwise go to next step.

- If you are presented with a list of accounts, that means you have several Google accounts already authenticated at the same time, so click on the account with which you want to sign in to ezkomment.

- The pop-up should close automatically and you will be redirected to the ezkomment dashboard. You have successfully created your ezkomment account.

## Create a new site

- Visit [the user dashboard](https://ezkomment.joulev.dev/app/dashboard). It will be where all of your sites are listed.

- The dashboard should not look too exciting yet, since you have not created anything. Go ahead and click on "Add a new site". Alternatively, you can click on "New site" on the navigation bar.

- Input the site name. The site name must be a valid URL slug (since it will feature in the site dashboard URL). If you know what a URL slug is, input whatever you like, otherwise let's continue by inputting `blog` for now (you can change this later).

- Input the site domain. If you already have a website deployed to the Internet, you can input the domain (including the subdomain if you want). Otherwise let's continue by inputting `*` (one single asterisk) for now (once again, you can change this later).

- Click on "Add a new site".

- You will be redirected to your _site dashboard_. You have successfully created a new ezkomment site!
