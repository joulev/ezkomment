# Delete site

You can always delete an ezkomment site.

As usual, **this is irreversible and dangerous**. Site deletion will wipe out all pages under that site forever, with no means of recovering. All comment sections under that site will simply stop working.

If you have understood the consequences of site deletion, continue as follows:

- Visit the site dashboard, either from the [overall dashboard](/app/dashboard) or from the URL in this syntax

  ```
  https://ezkomment.joulev.dev/app/site/⟨siteName⟩
  ```

- On the navigation bar, click on **Settings**.

- Under **Delete site**, click on **Delete this site**.

- A modal will appear. Read it carefully; if you still want to delete that site, follow the instructions on the modal and click **Delete**.

- The site, along with all information associated to it, is now gone forever.
