# Update site information

You can always update all information associated to an ezkomment site.

- Visit the site dashboard, either from the [overall dashboard](/app/dashboard) or from the URL in this syntax

  ```
  https://ezkomment.joulev.dev/app/site/⟨siteName⟩
  ```

- On the navigation bar, click on **Settings**

- Under **Basic information**, you can now update the site name, site domain and site icon (the icon displayed on the overall dashboard).

Do note the following:

- [The restrictions on site name](/docs/comments/create-new-sites#site-name) still apply.

- If you change the site domain to anything other than `*`, the comment section [will no longer be embeddable to your old domain](/docs/comments/create-new-sites#site-domain).
