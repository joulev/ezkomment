# The comment section

After [creating a page](/docs/sites-and-pages/create-new-page), the page will have a comment section ready to go.

- On the page dashboard, you will see a section named **Your comment section is live!**.

  ![You will see this in the dashboard](/images/docs/comments/the-comment-section/comment-section-link.png)

- Under it, there is a URL in the following format

  ```
  https://ezkomment.joulev.dev/embed/⟨siteId⟩/⟨pageId⟩
  ```

  Click on **Copy** at the right to copy the URL to the clipboard.

- You can now visit the comment section by visiting this link in a browser.

- Try to post a new comment to it &ndash; it works now!

You may notice that there are no margins. This is because the comment section is intended to be embedded instead of viewed directly like that. To continue, we will see [how to embed this comment section to your website](/docs/comments/embed).
