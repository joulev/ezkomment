# Sites and pages

Throughout the application, the terms _sites_ and _pages_ will be used a lot.

Each page corresponds to a comment section. The page may be a blog post, an announcement, a changelog entry, etc. for which a comment section is reasonable.

Each site is a collection of pages that share the following properties:

- Domain/subdomain ([unless you specifically set the site domain to `*`](/docs/comments/create-new-sites.md#site-domain))
- Design of comment section ([see more](https://google.com))

For example, assume that you have two web applications at `foo.com` and `bar.com`. Normally you would want to create two sites, one for `foo.com` and one for `bar.com`; for each site you would want to create a page for every comment section you need to have.

## Should I create a new site or a new page?

Is your webpage already under the domain of a ezkomment site? In that case you should [add a new page](https://google.com) under that ezkomment site.

Otherwise, we recommend you create a new site for the domain of that webpage, then add a new page under that newly-created ezkomment site.
