# Delete page

You can always delete an ezkomment page.

As usual, **this is irreversible and dangerous**. Page deletion will wipe out all comments under that page, with no means of recovering. Obviously, the comment section for that page will also stop working.

If you have understood the consequences of page deletion, continue as follows:

- Visit the page dashboard from the site dashboard.

- On the navigation bar, click on **Settings**.

- Under **Page deletion**, click on **Delete this page**.

- A modal will appear. Read it carefully.

- If you still want to delete the page, type in **delete this page**.

- Click on **Delete**.

- The page, along with all information associated to it, is now gone forever.
